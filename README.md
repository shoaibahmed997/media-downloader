# Hello,

## This is a port of cobalt using fast api and react.

the original project is made with express and svelte.
but i want to make it with fast api and react. mostly for learning purpose, but also to make it more modern and efficient.
originally i wanted to make it with go, but i decided to go with python fastapi.
i will try to integrate it with some cool ai tools later in the end to make it more fun and useful.

The link to the original project is [here](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt)
